How exciting!</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.</p>
<p>Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg">salted duck eggs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>

<p>Simitri
Explore the beauty of mathematics with ’Simitri’, an iPad app which lets you create beautiful colourful patterns based on simple mathematical rules.
The app introduces transformations and symmetry groups (’
wallpaper groups’) and then allows you to draw your own patterns using your chosen symmetries.
It is an interesting fact that there are precisely 17 symmetry groups in two dimensions, and this app explains each one with interactive animations and examples from art and archaeology. When you’re happy with your artwork you can save the images to your iPad, your camera roll, or show them off on Facebook and Twitter. A public gallery also showcases the best designs from around the world!
Learn about the 17 wallpaper groups
Understand translations, rotations, reflections and glide reflections with colourful animations
See examples of the beauty of symmetry and mathematics in the decorative arts and historical artifacts
Draw your own patterns using a choice of templates and colours

<p>Logotacular
Logotacular is a colourful app to help you learn ’Logo’, a programming language designed to assist in learning geometry and programming.
The most basic commands in Logotacular are the ’go forward’ command and the ’turn right’ command. You use these commands to control a small on-screen ’turtle’, which draws a colourful path as it moves. You can change the background color, line color and the thickness of the lines drawn, as well as and raising/lowering the pen. Loops can be programmed by use of the ’repeat’ command which tells the turtle to execute a set of commands a specific number of times.</p>
<p>More advanced users can use variables are used to tell the turtle the value assigned to a letter, and functions (or ’procedures’) are used to name a set of commands so that you can easily execute them later, all concepts useful in learning other programming languages!
Logo was created in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig and Seymour Papert - researchers at MIT university. Their goal was to create an easy to learn application where kids could play with words and the structure of sentences. Later versions of Logo included on screen graphics and the forward and right commands to move an on-screen ’turtle’ around the screen. In 1969, a physical robot was designed which would move across the floor tracing its path with a pen. Seymour Papert pioneered its use in school classrooms as an educational system in the early 1970’s.

<p>Employment history
May 2014 - July 2014:
I moved to Bangalore for a few months after finishing my contract at HeyMath! I took a one month Objective-C course and worked on learning the language and getting my first app in the App Store (Simitri).
April 2012 - April 2014:Director of Numbers &#x26; Pictures Ltd, working as consultant for HeyMath! (Product Manager / Developer)
My two main projects were called “HeyMath! from Singapore” and “fasTest”. HeyMath! from Singapore is an iPad app, built with Backbone.js and Phonegap. It displays to the user a video bank of animated ’lessons’ and an assessment module. I designed and coded the entire front end (using Backbone.js, Underscore.js, CSS, (Less) and integrated the Phonegap plugin for In-App Purchase). It has a bright colourful design with avatars for each user in a family, a search functionality, and a lot of CSS transitions to make the app more fun to use. It includes Facebook login, although this is not currently active. I was also responsible for managing the timelines of the project, and developers working on the backend API, as well as creating marketing assets. The app is available on the App Store.</p>
<p>FasTest is a web app that presents a real-time dashboard to teachers for showing the correct/wrong answers given by students in a test. Teachers issue a test, give their students a room number, can send notes to students as the test progresses and are given a report when the test ends. It is written in Backbone.js using jQuery mobile for the UI. It uses various Javascript libraries (eg. Sketch.js, Raphaël) to allow users to draw sketches and to display the graphs of student performance. I also managed the project and the development of the backend API. It is designed for the iPad, optimized for lower-end devices and works on the web too.
Sept 2009 - March 2012: Freelance Actionscript Developer
Client: Scholastic Publishing Ltd - HotTopics, Create and Display and Data Handling.
Development of educational applications for the primary school curriculum - these are best described as slideshow engines (accompanying paper publications) suitable for primary school pupils and teachers.

A fully XML driven Actionscript 3 flip-book engine for creation of educational books for primary school children. Using my own custom MVC framework. I designed and coded the flip-book engine and used it to create 64 flip books. Features include realistic page turn effects, page navigation, text searching, fully configurable ’hotspots’ (displaying rich media such as audio, definitions of difficult words, video, animations, photos), and save-able teacher annotations - notes, scribbles and highlighting. Also development of CD-ROM installers for Windows and Mac OSX.
Client: Spring Digital Flash/Actionscript web projects - photo galleries, photo timelines, staff photo widget. All easily updateable XML driven Actionscript 3 projects.
March 2010 - March 2012: Self employed private tutor (part time)
Predominantly teaching A Levels maths to private students in London, I have also taught GCSE maths, A Level Further Maths and STEP (the “Cambridge Entrance Exam” for maths). I have taught approximately 20 students, mostly in the time when my software products had gone for testing.
Aug 2008 - Aug 2009: Actionscript Developer at www.samlearning.com
Part of a team of two, developing of software for in-house and external authors to create educational material. The editing tool is written in Actionscript 3, is somewhat similar to Powerpoint in design and enables those with no programming knowledge to create educational activities. XML based, each activity contains a number of components such as text areas, graphs, equations and images, as well as fully configurable questions such as multiple choice, fill in the blank, drag ’n’ drop. The application comprises the editor and a player - in which completed activities are displayed to the student step by step with accompanying sound files for each step, as well as hints and answers (in the form of text, equations, images and sound), all created by an author with no programming required. Over 800 Actionscript classes, using our own MVC based framework.
Feb 2008 - Jun 2008: Freelance Actionscript Developer
Client: Sherston Publishing Group. Two Actionscript 3 science simulations for Sherston’s “BBC science sims” series (drainage through soil and dental hygiene) to enable teachers to demonstrate Keystage 2 science principles. These are highly code-based and feature high levels of interactivity. I designed the activities from scratch based on the UK schools curriculum and wrote all code. I believe SPG went out of business before these were published!
Feb 2007 - Feb 2008 : Freelance Actionscript Developer
Client: Sherston Publishing Group. Return to Mechania is an educational CD-ROM product. It is half simulation, half game, and enables teachers and pupils at Keystages 2 and 3 to explore many different kinds of mechanisms and mechanical principles - cams, moments, linkages, gears, pneumatics and pulleys. I designed the storyline, educational content and all 12 activities from scratch as well as writing all code (Actionscript 2).
In the ’explore’ mode pupils are given a machine and can interact with it as if it were real - hang weights on a balancing bar, place a cam on a rotating axle, mesh gears together, load pulleys with weights and connect plastic syringes for example. Each exploration has a stripped down mathematical diagram view to see the essentials of the scenario (forces, weights and lengths for example) The ’adventure’ mode places each machine in a fantasy world of Mechania, where you must use your knowledge to help the Mechanians recover their kingdom.</p>
<p>Aug 2005 - Sept 2006: Product Manager
&#x26;
Aug 2002 - Aug 2005: Educational Consultant at www.heymath.com

My work involved the creation of e-learning material: lessons, animations, games, activities and teacher-tools. This required knowledge of the syllabus in Singapore, India and the US, an ability to connect with the learner through interesting animated material and then creating the material (Actionscript 2). Also quality control of the above in the content-development team, and providing improvements.
In 2005-2006 I fully designed and implemented an online gifted/accelerated programme in maths for US grades 6 to 10. This involved designing the website, as well as code to load worksheets and timed exams into the students’ view. I was also responsible for managing a team of web and database programmers and met with the Mathematics Department of Raffles School in Singapore to discuss and design the content of the course. Student contact included creation and running of several internet-based maths projects with groups of students in Singapore. Also making and running face-to-face maths games/activities for groups of Indian and Singaporean students. </p>

My resumé </p>
<p>MSc project - A Logo programming environment for Lego Mindstorms™ Robots
I completed an MSc in Software Engineering from the University of Westminster in London in 2010 with a ’distinction’ grade, and my final year project was a Java application for students to program Lego Mindstorms™ robots in Logo.
Logo, or ’Turtle Math’ is a simple language which has been used in schools for decades to help introduce children to the concepts of computer programming. On a normal computer, ’fd 10’ moves the turtle forward 10 units and rpt 4 [fd 10 rt 90] draws a square.
My application allowed a list of users to share one robot, to write Logo and execute the commands in a Java Swing GUI. When ready, the user in charge of the robot could execute the commands on the robot and it would move along the ground, drawing geometric shapes as it goes.
The final project report (pdf) is available here
All source code (Java) is available here, in 6 separate NetBeans projects for the Logo interpreter, front end, back end, libraries and code to run on the robot itself.
Lego Mindstorms robot re-flashed with Lejos (Tiny Java VM) instead of Lego’s firmware
GUI built with Java Swing and the Java port of PureMVC
Logo interpreter written from scratch using JavaCC, supporting basic math, fd, rt, rpt, variables, simple functions and scope
Simple backend to manage user lists logged on to the app (also in Java)
Bluetooth communication to send Logo commands to the robot
A Logo turtle has only a location on screen and an orientation…Indeed, the Turtle is like a person: “I am here and I am facing north…” And from these similarities comes the Turtle’s special ability to serve as a representative of formal mathematics for a child.
Seymour Papert, inventor of Logo and consultant for Lego Mindstorms™ robots
