Users are given a huge set of ready-made slides (images, pdf worksheets, graphs, videos and audio files) and can drag and drop to create slideshows. Ready made slideshows are provided, but your own images, videos and sounds can be imported. Each slide can be annotated using drawing and text tools. Each CD-ROM contains differentiated lesson plans for three age groups, and printable activity sheets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Captivate your class and bring the curriculum to life! Hot Topics Interactive helps you to teach your favourite topics with all the support and planning you need. These exciting resource CD-ROMs make it easy to teach exciting topics that span the whole curriculum, covering more subjects in less time and having lots of creative fun. Just one Hot Topics Interactive theme lets children discover and learn from dozens of angles: doing experiments, making crafts and models, playing games and much more.</p>\n<p><cite><a href="https://shop.scholastic.co.uk/series/848">https://shop.scholastic.co.uk/series/848</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Actionscript 3, using Flex and PureMVC</li>\n<li>Wrapped with MDM Zinc to create Windows and Mac installable executables</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide1.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide1.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide2.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide2.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide3.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide3.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide4.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide4.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide6.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide6.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide7.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide7.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide8.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide8.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide9.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide9.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/hottopics/slide11.png"><img src="/img/hottopics/slide11.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a></p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Data Handling &#x26; Create and Display</h2>\n<p>These series extend the source code of the Hot Topics project and add extra functionality. “Data Handling” includes a large range of annotation and graphing tools which let teachers and pupils annotate slides, create their own slideshows and add graphs to illustrate the data.

There are twelve lessons per book, each covering learning objectives for both maths and the subjects covered in the data. The lesson framework outlines how to teach the lesson, ways to differentiate for learners of varying abilities, and there’s all the data provided along with worksheets to guide you.</p>\n<p><cite><a target="_blank"  href="http://shop.scholastic.co.uk/series/838">http://shop.scholastic.co.uk/series/838</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a target="_blank" href="/img/createanddisplay/slide1.png"><img src="/img/createanddisplay/slide1.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/createanddisplay/slide2.png"><img src="/img/createanddisplay/slide2.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a>\n<a target="_blank" href="/img/createanddisplay/slide3.png"><img src="/img/createanddisplay/slide3.png" style="width: 32%;"/></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The software includes a full suite of Interactive Whiteboard tools, and lets the teacher adapt the slideshows, upload their own images, or even create entirely new slideshows of their classwork.
