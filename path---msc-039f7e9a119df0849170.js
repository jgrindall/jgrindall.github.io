In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-3f5a1.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Chinese Salty Egg"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-f8fb9.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-e8976.jpg 148w,\n/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-63df2.jpg 295w,\n/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\n/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-85e3d.jpg 885w,\n/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-d1924.jpg 1180w,\n/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-9452e.jpg 1770w,\n/static/salty_egg-8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a-3f5a1.jpg 2048w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>MSc Software Engineering, University of Westminster (Distinction). Courses included C++, Data structures and algorithms, Java, SQL, UML and some more theoretical computer science. My final year project title was “A Logo programming environment for Lego Mindstorms™ robots” and dealt with creating a Java application for students to use to program a robot to draw geometric shapes. It used JavaCC to create the grammar parser, Java socketing, Lejos (a tiny Java virtual machine for the Robot), and PureMVC for the front end. More info is available here, or you can read the project dissertation here or the source code is here.\nOct 2001 - Jul 2002:\nMSc project - A Logo programming environment for Lego Mindstorms™ Robots\nI completed an MSc in Software Engineering from the University of Westminster in London in 2010 with a ’distinction’ grade, and my final year project was a Java application for students to program Lego Mindstorms™ robots in Logo.\nLogo, or ’Turtle Math’ is a simple language which has been used in schools for decades to help introduce children to the concepts of computer programming. On a normal computer, ’fd 10’ moves the turtle forward 10 units and rpt 4 [fd 10 rt 90] draws a square.\nMy application allowed a list of users to share one robot, to write Logo and execute the commands in a Java Swing GUI. When ready, the user in charge of the robot could execute the commands on the robot and it would move along the ground, drawing geometric shapes as it goes.\nThe final project report (pdf) is available here\nAll source code (Java) is available here, in 6 separate NetBeans projects for the Logo interpreter, front end, back end, libraries and code to run on the robot itself.\nLego Mindstorms robot re-flashed with Lejos (Tiny Java VM) instead of Lego’s firmware\nGUI built with Java Swing and the Java port of PureMVC\nLogo interpreter written from scratch using JavaCC, supporting basic math, fd, rt, rpt, variables, simple functions and scope\nSimple backend to manage user lists logged on to the app (also in Java)\nBluetooth communication to send Logo commands to the robot\nA Logo turtle has only a location on screen and an orientation…Indeed, the Turtle is like a person: “I am here and I am facing north…” And from these similarities comes the Turtle’s special ability to serve as a representative of formal mathematics for a child.\nSeymour Papert, inventor of Logo and consultant for Lego Mindstorms™ robots\nCheck it out!\nMSc dissertation\nsrc on github\nLogotacular\nLogotacular is a web and iPad app designed to introduce novices to programming and geometry. I built a Flex version using RobotLegs and antlr, with a CodeIgniter backend, and a Javascript version using Backbone.js and easel.js, with a node/mongodb backend, Facebook login and a parser using peg.js.\nNow, I am only working on improving the iPad version, much improved, and built in Objective C.\nCheck it out!\nSee the app page\nsrc on github\nActionscript 3 Logo interpreter\nAn Actionscript 3 Logo interpreter, using using Flex 3 and the RobotLegs framework, with the parser written using antlr, a backend using CodeIgniter (PHP) (PHP) and an AIR desktop version also.\nLogo interpreter written in Flex, using antlr to generate the Parser and RobotLegs for MVCS.\nFile saving and loading implemented using WebService (for web) and Adobe AIR FileSystem (for desktop), disabled in the app below.\nSrc on github\nParser library on github\nOther stuff\nSimple 3d engine I wrote from scratch (AS3), showing the Platonic, Archimedian and Catalan solids\nSpirograph!\nBased on an exhibit in the London Science musuem, this apparatus was used to change the scale of engineering drawings.\nExplore the 17 wallapper groups\n3d experiments\n </p>',frontmatter:{title:"Msc",thumbnails2:["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg"],thumbnail:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/msc/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/logotacular/"},frontmatter:{title:"Logotac",thumbnail:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg",thumbnails2:["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg"]}},next:{fields:{slug:"/hottopics/"},frontmatter:{title:"Hot",thumbnail:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg",thumbnails2:["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/images/featurebox_sidebar_kids/grief-and-loss.jpg","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SfLV8hD7zX4/maxresdefault.jpg"]}}}}}});
