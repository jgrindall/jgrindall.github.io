This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

Explore the beauty of mathematics with &#8217;Simitri&#8217;, an iPad app which lets you create beautiful colourful patterns based on simple mathematical rules.
The app introduces transformations and symmetry groups (&#8217;
wallpaper groups&#8217;) and then allows you to draw your own patterns using your chosen symmetries.
It is an interesting fact that there are precisely 17 symmetry groups in two dimensions, and this app explains each one with interactive animations and examples from art and archaeology. When you&#8217;re happy with your artwork you can save the images to your iPad, your camera roll, or show them off on Facebook and Twitter. A public gallery also showcases the best designs from around the world!
