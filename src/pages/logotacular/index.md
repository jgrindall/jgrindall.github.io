Logotacular is a colourful iPad app to help you learn &#8217;Logo&#8217;, a programming language designed to assist in learning geometry and programming.
The most basic commands in Logotacular are the &#8217;go forward&#8217; command and the &#8217;turn right&#8217; command. You use these commands to control a small on-screen &#8217;turtle&#8217;, which draws a path as it moves. You can change the background color, line color and the thickness of the lines drawn, as well as and raising/lowering the pen. Loops can be programmed by use of the &#8217;repeat&#8217; command which tells the turtle to execute a set of commands a specific number of times.

More advanced users can use variables are used to tell the turtle the value assigned to a letter, and functions (or &#8217;procedures&#8217;) are used to name a set of commands so that you can easily execute them later, all concepts useful in learning other programming languages.

Use Logotacular to learn about:

* Algorithms
* Testing and debugging
* Use of variables and functions
* Repeating - using loops
* Recursion
* Variable scope
* Program control and branching
* Lengths and angles
* Interior and exterior angles and polygons
* Circles and curve-based shapes

>Logo was created in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig and Seymour Papert - researchers at MIT university. Their goal was to create an easy to learn application where kids could play with words and the structure of sentences. Later versions of Logo included on screen graphics and the forward and right commands to move an on-screen &#8217;turtle&#8217; around the screen. In 1969, a physical robot was designed which would move across the floor tracing its path with a pen. Seymour Papert pioneered its use in school classrooms as an educational system in the early 1970&#8217;s.
