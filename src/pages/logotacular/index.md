This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

Logotacular
Logotacular is a colourful app to help you learn &#8217;Logo&#8217;, a programming language designed to assist in learning geometry and programming.
The most basic commands in Logotacular are the &#8217;go forward&#8217; command and the &#8217;turn right&#8217; command. You use these commands to control a small on-screen &#8217;turtle&#8217;, which draws a colourful path as it moves. You can change the background color, line color and the thickness of the lines drawn, as well as and raising/lowering the pen. Loops can be programmed by use of the &#8217;repeat&#8217; command which tells the turtle to execute a set of commands a specific number of times.
 
More advanced users can use variables are used to tell the turtle the value assigned to a letter, and functions (or &#8217;procedures&#8217;) are used to name a set of commands so that you can easily execute them later, all concepts useful in learning other programming languages!
Logo was created in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig and Seymour Papert - researchers at MIT university. Their goal was to create an easy to learn application where kids could play with words and the structure of sentences. Later versions of Logo included on screen graphics and the forward and right commands to move an on-screen &#8217;turtle&#8217; around the screen. In 1969, a physical robot was designed which would move across the floor tracing its path with a pen. Seymour Papert pioneered its use in school classrooms as an educational system in the early 1970&#8217;s.

Logotacular
Logotacular is a web and iPad app designed to introduce novices to programming and geometry. I built a Flex version using RobotLegs and antlr, with a CodeIgniter backend, and a Javascript version using Backbone.js and easel.js, with a node/mongodb backend, Facebook login and a parser using peg.js.
 Now, I am only working on improving the iPad version, much improved, and built in Objective C.
Check it out!

Actionscript 3 Logo interpreter
An Actionscript 3 Logo interpreter, using using Flex 3 and the RobotLegs framework, with the parser written using antlr, a backend using CodeIgniter (PHP) (PHP) and an AIR desktop version also.
Logo interpreter written in Flex, using antlr to generate the Parser and RobotLegs for MVCS.
File saving and loading implemented using WebService (for web) and Adobe AIR FileSystem (for desktop), disabled in the app below.
