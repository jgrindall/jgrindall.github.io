Return to Mechania contains &#8217;adventure&#8217; and &#8217;explore&#8217; modes. In the &#8217;explore&#8217; mode pupils are given a machine and can interact with it as if it were real - hang weights on a balancing bar, place a cam on a rotating axle, mesh gears together, load pulleys with weights and connect plastic syringes for example.
Each exploration has a stripped down mathematical diagram view to see the essentials of the scenario (forces, weights and lengths for example)

The &#8217;adventure&#8217; mode places each machine in a fantasy world of Mechania, where you must use your knowledge to help the Mechanians recover their kingdom!
