This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

MSc Software Engineering, University of Westminster (Distinction). Courses included C++, Data structures and algorithms, Java, SQL, UML and some more theoretical computer science. My final year project title was "A Logo programming environment for Lego Mindstorms&trade; robots" and dealt with creating a Java application for students to use to program a robot to draw geometric shapes. It used JavaCC to create the grammar parser, Java socketing, Lejos (a tiny Java virtual machine for the Robot), and PureMVC for the front end. More info is available here, or you can read the project dissertation here or the source code is here.

MSc project - A Logo programming environment for Lego Mindstorms&trade; Robots
I completed an MSc in Software Engineering from the University of Westminster in London in 2010 with a &#8217;distinction&#8217; grade, and my final year project was a Java application for students to program Lego Mindstorms&trade; robots in Logo.
Logo, or &#8217;Turtle Math&#8217; is a simple language which has been used in schools for decades to help introduce children to the concepts of computer programming. On a normal computer, &#8217;fd 10&#8217; moves the turtle forward 10 units and rpt 4 [fd 10 rt 90] draws a square.
My application allowed a list of users to share one robot, to write Logo and execute the commands in a Java Swing GUI. When ready, the user in charge of the robot could execute the commands on the robot and it would move along the ground, drawing geometric shapes as it goes.
The final project report (pdf) is available here
All source code (Java) is available here, in 6 separate NetBeans projects for the Logo interpreter, front end, back end, libraries and code to run on the robot itself.
Lego Mindstorms robot re-flashed with Lejos (Tiny Java VM) instead of Lego&#8217;s firmware
GUI built with Java Swing and the Java port of PureMVC
Logo interpreter written from scratch using JavaCC, supporting basic math, fd, rt, rpt, variables, simple functions and scope
Simple backend to manage user lists logged on to the app (also in Java)
Bluetooth communication to send Logo commands to the robot
 A Logo turtle has only a location on screen and an orientation&hellip;Indeed, the Turtle is like a person: "I am here and I am facing north..." And from these similarities comes the Turtle&#8217;s special ability to serve as a representative of formal mathematics for a child.

Logotacular
Logotacular is a web and iPad app designed to introduce novices to programming and geometry. I built a Flex version using RobotLegs and antlr, with a CodeIgniter backend, and a Javascript version using Backbone.js and easel.js, with a node/mongodb backend, Facebook login and a parser using peg.js.
 Now, I am only working on improving the iPad version, much improved, and built in Objective C.
Check it out!

Actionscript 3 Logo interpreter
An Actionscript 3 Logo interpreter, using using Flex 3 and the RobotLegs framework, with the parser written using antlr, a backend using CodeIgniter (PHP) (PHP) and an AIR desktop version also.
Logo interpreter written in Flex, using antlr to generate the Parser and RobotLegs for MVCS.
File saving and loading implemented using WebService (for web) and Adobe AIR FileSystem (for desktop), disabled in the app below.
